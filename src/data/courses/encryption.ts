        spokenContent: 'Welcome to Encryption Basics! At its heart, encryption is the art of secret writing. You take your "plaintext"—messages anyone can read—and scramble them into "ciphertext" using a mathematical algorithm and a secret key. To anyone without that key, your data looks like absolute gibberish, keeping your most private information safe.',

        spokenContent: 'People often confuse encryption with hashing, but they are very different. Encryption is meant to be undone—you want to read the data later. Hashing is a one-way trip. You turn data into a unique digital fingerprint. If even one letter of the data changes, the fingerprint changes completely, making it perfect for checking if data has been tampered with.',
