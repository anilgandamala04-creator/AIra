        spokenContent: 'Welcome to Stock Market Basics! Stocks are more than just numbers on a screen; they represent actual ownership in a company. When you buy a share, you become a shareholder — a partial owner. If the company succeeds and grows, your "slice of the pie" becomes more valuable, allowing you to build wealth alongside the businesses you believe in.',

        spokenContent: 'Think of a stock exchange like a high-tech global auction house. On exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, buyers and sellers come together to trade. Prices aren\'t fixed; they move every second based on supply and demand. If a company announces a breakthrough and everyone wants to buy, the price goes up. It’s a real-time reflection of the world\'s confidence in a business.',
