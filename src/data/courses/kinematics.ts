        content: 'Kinematics is the study of motion without considering forces. It describes how objects move using position, velocity, and acceleration over time.',

        content: 'Position is where an object is. Displacement is the change in position (vector). Distance is the total path length traveled (scalar). Displacement can be zero even if distance is not.',
        spokenContent: 'Position tells us where something is. Displacement is the straight-line change in position - it has direction. Distance is how far you actually traveled. If you walk in a circle and return, displacement is zero but distance is not.',

        spokenContent: 'Velocity is speed with direction. If you drive 60 miles per hour north, that is velocity. Speed is just 60 miles per hour - no direction. Velocity changes if you change direction, even if speed stays the same.',

        content: 'Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. It occurs when speed changes, direction changes, or both. Constant acceleration leads to predictable motion equations.',
        spokenContent: 'Acceleration means velocity is changing. You accelerate when you speed up, slow down, or change direction. Even turning at constant speed is acceleration because direction changes. Constant acceleration gives us useful equations.',
