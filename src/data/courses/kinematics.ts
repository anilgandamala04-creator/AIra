        content: 'Kinematics is the study of motion without considering forces. It describes how objects move using position, velocity, and acceleration over time.',
        spokenContent: 'Welcome to Kinematics! This branch of physics describes the "how" of motion — where things are, how fast they move, and how they speed up — without worrying about the "why" or the forces behind it. It is the vital foundation for all classical physics.',

        title: 'Position, Displacement, and Distance',
        content: 'Position is where an object is. Displacement is the change in position (vector). Distance is the total path length traveled (scalar). Displacement can be zero even if distance is not.',
        spokenContent: 'Position tells us where something is in a coordinate system. Displacement is the straight-line change in position — it is a vector, so direction matters. Distance, however, is the total path you actually traveled. If you run a complete lap around a track, your distance is 400 meters, but your displacement is zero because you ended right where you started.',

        title: 'Velocity and Speed',
        content: 'Velocity is displacement divided by time (vector, has direction). Speed is distance divided by time (scalar, no direction). Average velocity considers direction; average speed does not.',
        spokenContent: 'Velocity is speed with a direction. If you drive 60 miles per hour north, that is your velocity. Speed is just the reading on your speedometer — 60 miles per hour — with no direction. In physics, velocity changes if you turn or change direction, even if your speed stays exactly the same.',

        title: 'Acceleration',
        content: 'Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. It occurs when speed changes, direction changes, or both. Constant acceleration leads to predictable motion equations.',
        spokenContent: 'Acceleration measures how quickly velocity is changing. You are accelerating when you step on the gas, hit the brakes, or simply steer around a corner. Because velocity includes direction, even turning at a steady speed is a form of acceleration. This concept allows us to predict the future state of any moving object.',

        content: 'The kinematic equations relate position, velocity, acceleration, and time. They apply when acceleration is constant, allowing us to predict future motion from current state.',
        spokenContent: 'The four kinematic equations are the mathematician\'s toolkit for motion. If we know the initial starting point, the starting speed, and the constant acceleration, these formulas allow us to calculate exactly where an object will be and how fast it will be moving at any moment in the future.',
