        content: 'REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs.',
        spokenContent: 'Welcome to RESTful API Design! REST is a way to design web services that are simple, scalable, and easy to use. It uses standard HTTP methods that you already know. Think of it as a set of rules that allow different software systems to talk to each other over the web using the same language.',
