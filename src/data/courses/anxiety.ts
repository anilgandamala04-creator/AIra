        spokenContent: 'Welcome to the science of Anxiety. Anxiety isn\'t just "in your head"—it is a deeply rooted biological survival mechanism. It is your brain\'s smoke detector, designed to keep you safe. We will explore how this system works, and what happens when it becomes overly sensitive to the stresses of modern life.',

By changing the way we think about a situation, we can lower our physical anxiety and choose healthier ways to react. It is about taking the steering wheel back from your amygdala.',
