        content: 'Graphs have vertices (nodes) and edges (connections). Edges can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way). Graphs can be weighted (edges have values) or unweighted.',

        spokenContent: 'To explore a graph, we use traversal algorithms. Depth-first search goes deep into one path before trying others, like exploring a maze. Breadth-first search explores level by level, like ripples in water.',
