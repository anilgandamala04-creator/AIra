        spokenContent: 'Welcome to the anatomy of coronary circulation! While the heart pumps blood to the entire body, it also needs its own dedicated supply of oxygen. The coronary arteries wrap around the heart like a crown, ensuring every beat of the muscle is powered by fresh, oxygenated blood.',

        spokenContent: 'The Left Coronary Artery is often called the "Mother Ship." It quickly splits into the LAD, which runs down the front, and the Circumflex, which wraps around the back. Together, they feed the massive left ventricle—the heart’s primary pump.',

        spokenContent: 'Problems arise when plaque—made of fat and cholesterol—builds up inside these narrow tubes. This "Atherosclerosis" restricts blood flow. If a plaque ruptures, it can cause a sudden blockage, leading to a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, where the heart muscle begins to die from lack of oxygen.',
