        title: 'Introduction to Coronary Arteries',
        content: 'The coronary arteries are the blood vessels that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle itself. There are two main coronary arteries: the left and right coronary arteries, each with important branches.',
        spokenContent: 'Welcome to Coronary Arteries! These are the vital blood vessels that feed your heart muscle. Without them, your heart cannot function. Let us explore their structure and importance.',

        title: 'Left Coronary Artery',
        content: 'The left coronary artery (LCA) branches into the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries. The LAD supplies the front and left side of the heart, while the LCX supplies the back.',
        spokenContent: 'The left coronary artery splits into two major branches. The left anterior descending artery runs down the front of the heart, supplying the left ventricle. The circumflex artery wraps around the back.',

        title: 'Right Coronary Artery',
        content: 'The right coronary artery (RCA) supplies blood to the right atrium, right ventricle, and often the bottom portion of the left ventricle. It also supplies the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes.',
        spokenContent: 'The right coronary artery travels along the right side of the heart. It feeds the right chambers and is crucial for the heart\'s electrical system, supplying the nodes that control heart rhythm.',

        title: 'Coronary Artery Disease',
        content: 'Coronary artery disease occurs when these arteries become narrowed or blocked by plaque buildup (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow to the heart muscle and potentially causing chest pain or heart attacks.',
        spokenContent: 'When coronary arteries become blocked, it is called coronary artery disease. This can cause chest pain, known as angina, or lead to heart attacks if blood flow is completely cut off.',
