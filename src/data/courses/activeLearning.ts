        spokenContent: 'Welcome to the Future of Education! Active learning is a shift in power. Instead of a "sage on the stage" giving a lecture, the student becomes the architect of their own knowledge. It is about learning by doing, thinking, and reflecting, rather than just absorbing information.',

        spokenContent: 'Why do we use active learning? Because it works. Studies show we only remember about 10% of what we read, but 90% of what we teach to others or do ourselves. This is called the Retention Pyramid, and it proves that the more active you are, the deeper the learning goes.',

It gives students a quiet moment to think, a safe space to discuss with one partner, and then the confidence to share with the whole group.
