        spokenContent: 'Welcome to Mendelian Heredity! This is the study of how traits are passed from parents to children. Gregor Mendel discovered the basic rules of inheritance in the 1800s using pea plants.',

        content: 'Genes are units of heredity located on chromosomes. Each gene can have different versions called alleles. For example, the gene for flower color might have a purple allele and a white allele.',
        spokenContent: 'Genes are instructions for traits, like a recipe. Each gene can have different versions called alleles. For eye color, you might have a brown allele or a blue allele. You get one from each parent.',

        content: 'Dominant alleles mask the effect of recessive alleles. If you have one dominant and one recessive allele, the dominant trait appears. Recessive traits only show when both alleles are recessive.',
        spokenContent: 'Some alleles are dominant, others recessive. Dominant alleles win - if you have one dominant and one recessive, you see the dominant trait. Recessive traits only appear when you have two recessive alleles.',

        spokenContent: 'Punnett squares help predict inheritance. You write one parent\'s alleles on top, the other\'s on the side, then fill in the boxes to see all possible combinations. This shows the probability of each outcome.',

        content: 'Mendel\'s Law of Segregation states that alleles separate during gamete formation. The Law of Independent Assortment states that genes for different traits assort independently.',
        spokenContent: 'Mendel discovered two key laws. Segregation means each parent contributes one allele randomly. Independent assortment means genes for different traits are inherited separately - eye color does not affect height.',
