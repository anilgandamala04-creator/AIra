        content: 'Heredity is the passing of traits from parents to offspring through genes. Gregor Mendel\'s experiments with pea plants established the fundamental principles of inheritance.',
        spokenContent: 'Welcome to Mendelian Heredity! This is the fascinating study of how traits — like the color of your eyes or the shape of a leaf — are passed from one generation to the next. Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics, discovered these basic rules in the 1860s by observing thousands of pea plant crosses.',

        title: 'Genes and Alleles',
        content: 'Genes are units of heredity located on chromosomes. Each gene can have different versions called alleles. For example, the gene for flower color might have a purple allele and a white allele.',
        spokenContent: 'Think of genes as the instruction manual for your body. Each specific instruction, like "flower color," is a gene. But these instructions can have variations, which we call alleles. You might have a "Purple" allele from one parent and a "White" allele from another. You inherit two alleles for every gene, one from each biological parent.',

        title: 'Dominant and Recessive',
        content: 'Dominant alleles mask the effect of recessive alleles. If you have one dominant and one recessive allele, the dominant trait appears. Recessive traits only show when both alleles are recessive.',
        spokenContent: 'Not all alleles are created equal. Some are "Dominant," meaning they will always show up if present. Others are "Recessive," and they only show their face if no dominant allele is around to mask them. This explains why two brown-eyed parents can sometimes have a blue-eyed child if they both carry the recessive "blue" allele.',

        content: 'Punnett squares are diagrams that predict the probability of offspring inheriting specific traits. They show all possible combinations of parental alleles.',
        spokenContent: 'To predict what offspring will look like, we use a Punnett square. It is a simple grid where we list one parent\'s alleles on top and the other\'s on the side. By filling in the boxes, we can see every possible genetic combination and calculate the exact probability of each outcome, like a 75% chance of purple flowers.',

        title: 'Mendel\'s Laws',
        content: 'Mendel\'s Law of Segregation states that alleles separate during gamete formation. The Law of Independent Assortment states that genes for different traits assort independently.',
        spokenContent: 'Mendel summarized his findings into two powerful laws. The Law of Segregation says that you only pass on ONE of your two alleles to your child, chosen at random. The Law of Independent Assortment says that inheriting one trait, like flower color, doesn\'t affect your chances of inheriting another, like plant height. These laws are the bedrock of modern genetics.',
