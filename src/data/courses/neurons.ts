        content: 'Neurons are specialized cells that transmit electrical and chemical signals throughout the nervous system. They are the basic building blocks of the brain and nervous system.',
        spokenContent: 'Neurons are the brain\'s communication specialists. Think of them as individual wires in a massive electrical grid. Your brain contains about 86 billion neurons, each capable of connecting to thousands of others, creating a web of intelligence more complex than the entire internet.',

        title: 'Neuron Structure',
        content: 'A neuron has three main parts: the cell body (soma) containing the nucleus, dendrites that receive signals, and an axon that transmits signals to other neurons.',
        spokenContent: 'Each neuron has a distinct structure perfectly designed for its job. The cell body, or soma, is the control center. Dendrites branch out like tree roots to receive signals from neighbors. The axon is a long, thin cable that sends signals away to its next destination.',

        title: 'How Neurons Communicate',
        content: 'Neurons communicate through synapses. An electrical signal (action potential) travels down the axon, triggering the release of neurotransmitters that cross the synaptic gap to the next neuron.',
        spokenContent: 'Communication happens at synapses, the microscopic gaps between neurons. An electrical impulse, called an action potential, races down the axon. When it reaches the end, it triggers the release of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. These jump the gap and "lock" into receptors on the next neuron, passing the message along in milliseconds.',

        title: 'Types of Neurons',
        content: 'There are three main types: sensory neurons (carry information from senses), motor neurons (control muscles), and interneurons (connect neurons within the brain and spinal cord).',
        spokenContent: 'Neurons are specialized for different tasks. Sensory neurons are like reporters, bringing info from your senses. Motor neurons are like commanders, telling your muscles to move. Interneurons are the brain\'s internal wiring, processing information and connecting the reporters to the commanders.',
