        content: 'Neurons are specialized cells that transmit electrical and chemical signals throughout the nervous system. They are the basic building blocks of the brain and nervous system.',
        spokenContent: 'Neurons are the brain\'s communication cells. Think of them as tiny wires that carry messages. Your brain contains about 86 billion neurons, each capable of connecting to thousands of others.',

        title: 'Neuron Structure',
        content: 'A neuron has three main parts: the cell body (soma) containing the nucleus, dendrites that receive signals, and an axon that transmits signals to other neurons.',
        spokenContent: 'Each neuron has a distinct structure. The cell body contains the nucleus and metabolic machinery. Dendrites branch out like tree roots to receive signals. The axon is a long fiber that sends signals away.',

        title: 'How Neurons Communicate',
        content: 'Neurons communicate through synapses. An electrical signal (action potential) travels down the axon, triggering the release of neurotransmitters that cross the synaptic gap to the next neuron.',
        spokenContent: 'Communication happens at synapses, the tiny gaps between neurons. An electrical impulse races down the axon, then chemical messengers called neurotransmitters jump the gap to activate the next neuron. This happens millions of times per second.',

        content: 'There are three main types: sensory neurons (carry information from senses), motor neurons (control muscles), and interneurons (connect neurons within the brain and spinal cord).',
        spokenContent: 'Neurons come in different types. Sensory neurons bring information from your senses. Motor neurons command your muscles to move. Interneurons are the brain\'s internal wiring, connecting everything together.',
