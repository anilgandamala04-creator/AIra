It is a long, delicate bundle of nervous tissue that extends from your brainstem all the way down your back. It is the primary pathway for every movement you make and every sensation you feel, connecting your brain to the world around you.',

Surrounding it is white matter, consisting of millions of myelinated fibers that carry signals up to the brain and down to your muscles. This delicate core is protected by three layers of membranes and cushioned by cerebrospinal fluid.',
