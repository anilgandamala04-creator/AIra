        title: 'The Cardiac Cycle',
        content: 'The cardiac cycle consists of systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation). During diastole, the heart fills with blood. During systole, the heart pumps blood out.',
        spokenContent: 'Understanding blood flow starts with the cardiac cycle. Think of it as a two-phase pump: relaxation, known as diastole, to fill the chambers, and contraction, or systole, to eject blood. This cycle repeats tirelessly about 60 to 100 times per minute, ensuring every cell in your body gets fresh oxygen.',

        title: 'Pulmonary Circulation',
        content: 'Deoxygenated blood flows from the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, then returns via pulmonary veins.',
        spokenContent: 'The right side of your heart is dedicated to pulmonary circulation. Deoxygenated blood travels from the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery to your lungs. There, it exchanges carbon dioxide for fresh oxygen before returning to the left atrium. It is a vital, low-pressure loop for gas exchange.',

        title: 'Blood Pressure & Flow',
        content: 'Blood pressure is highest in arteries (systolic) and lowest in veins. Pressure gradients drive blood flow, with the heart creating the pressure needed to circulate blood throughout the body.',
        spokenContent: 'Pressure is what keeps blood moving. It is highest in your major arteries right after the heart contracts and lowest in the small veins returning home. This "pressure gradient" ensures that blood always travels from high-pressure zones to low-pressure zones, reaching even the furthest capillaries.',
