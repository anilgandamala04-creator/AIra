        title: 'The Cardiac Cycle',
        content: 'The cardiac cycle consists of systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation). During diastole, the heart fills with blood. During systole, the heart pumps blood out.',
        spokenContent: 'Understanding blood flow starts with the cardiac cycle. Think of it as a two-phase pump: relaxation to fill, and contraction to eject. This cycle repeats about 60 to 100 times per minute.',

        spokenContent: 'The right side handles pulmonary circulation. Deoxygenated blood travels from the right ventricle to the lungs, exchanges gases, and returns oxygenated to the left atrium. This is a shorter, lower-pressure circuit.',

        spokenContent: 'The left side powers systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood is pumped from the left ventricle through the massive aorta to every organ and tissue. After delivering oxygen, it returns through veins to complete the circuit.',

        content: 'Blood pressure is highest in arteries (systolic) and lowest in veins. Pressure gradients drive blood flow, with the heart creating the pressure needed to circulate blood throughout the body.',
        spokenContent: 'Blood pressure creates the force for circulation. Systolic pressure peaks when the heart contracts, pushing blood into arteries. Diastolic pressure is the resting pressure between beats. This pressure gradient keeps blood moving.',
